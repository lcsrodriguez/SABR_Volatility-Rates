# SABR volatility model - Interest Rates

## Overview

This project studies the **SABR volatility model**. The purpose of this work is to implement and calibrate the SABR volatility model for **swaptions** in Python and study the impact of its parameters. First, it provides a close form solution for implied volatility that accurately captures the market smile volatility dynamics. Second, using market data of forward rates and swaption volatilities, we calibrate the parameters in order to obtain the implied volatilities.

Finally, an in-depth study of the impact of SABR parameters $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\rho$, $\nu$ is conducted.

Our summary and research approach is documented in the `.pdf` [report](docs/report.pdf).
