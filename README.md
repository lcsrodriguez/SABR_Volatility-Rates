# SABR volatility model - Interest Rates

## Overview

This project deals with **SABR volatility model**. The purpose of this work is to implement and calibrate the SABR volatility model for swaptions in Python. This model provides a close form solution for
implied volatility that accurately captures the market smile volatility dynamics. Using market data of forward rates and swaption volatilities, we calibrate the parameters in order to obtain the implied volatilities.

Finally, we will conduct an in-depth study of the impact of SABR models: $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\rho$, $\nu$.

Our summary and research approach is documented in the `.pdf` report [report](docs/report.pdf).
